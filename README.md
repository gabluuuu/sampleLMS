steps to run the "website" locally"

install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

if using MacOS, might be different link/methods, instructions more suited to windows :(

if instructions here not clear for mac/windows, refer here: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

change directory to the project folder/to the parent folder of the index.html file

if it's the first time trying to run it, first run: npm install

then run: npm run dev (if already ran npm install before, just run npm run dev)

in terminal, it will show link (e.g. http://localhost:5173/), open it. can now see project.
changes are shown everytime file is saved (ctrl/cmd + s)

can experiment changing things in the css, jsx files to see what are the effects. index.html file generally untouched unless changing what page is the main page for example, or linking to a different css/stylesheet file
